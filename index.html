	<p style="font-family:courier;">Since I was 5 years old, I have spent almost every weekend up at my lake house on the shores of Lake Burton. Lake Burton served as my safe haven to get away from the stresses of school, social life, and even boredom on some occassions. The town and the people in it are considered family. To this day, it is my home away from home. Lake Burton is a manmade lake that was created in 1919 in Rabun County Georgia, one of the wettest counties in Georgia. The name "Burton" derives from the town of Burton which now lies below the lake's surface. This town was a big contributor to the American gold rush on the east coast and the gold rush helped the town to grow over time. Once the town was evacuated, the Lake Burton dam was closed and the lake was created. Georgia Power now uses this land and lake for their company and families continue to use the lake for recreation.</p>
